# PORTFOLIO

Portfolio is a small project that I have always wanted to create but never had the courage to start it until now.
I never thought I would start developing in frontend environment as someone more experienced on the backend.
The motive is simple, I feel capable now thanks to my coworkers who helped me while I was facing a US that was completely about frontend.

So here we are.

## This is my journey:

### 14/09/2024 - 12:29 a.m

Created this document to write down my journey.
Also I should learn about how I can create components that extends html elements like a button.
Got some ideas for refactoring the App.tsx.

Since today I don't have too much time to dedicate to the portfolio. I was working on creating a Button component that uses html `button` element.
Also I am trying to import SVGs like this: `import { ReactComponent as ArrowPrev } from "./assets/arrow_prev.svg";` but no success YET.

### 15/09/2024 - 8:03 p.m

I have added some functionality to the next and previous project buttons. 
Somehow I got lost because I wasn't understanding why useState wasn't updating the state.
But solve it by changing a little bit the logic of currentProject and setCurrentProject. 

I have solved the svg problem too (couldn't import svg as react components).

My next objective is to fix some details on the project component, because buttons are "jumping" when the project div change its height due to its content.
Probably the best is to add some absolute positioning and relative...
