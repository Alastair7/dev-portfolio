# PORTFOLIO

Portfolio is a small project that I have always wanted to create but never had the courage to start it until now.
I never thought I would start developing in frontend environment as someone more experienced on the backend.
The motive is simple, I feel capable now thanks to my coworkers who helped me while I was facing a US that was completely about frontend.

So here we are.

## This is my journey:

### 14/09/2024 - 12:29 a.m

Created this document to write down my journey.
Also I should learn about how I can create components that extends html elements like a button.
Got some ideas for refactoring the App.tsx.

### 15/09/2024 - 1:29 p.m

Since today I don't have too much time to dedicate to the portfolio. I was working on creating a Button component that uses html `button` element.
Also I am trying to import SVGs like this: `import { ReactComponent as ArrowPrev } from "./assets/arrow_prev.svg";` but no success YET.
